## Prompt Engineering for Requirement Analysis {#prompt-engineering-for-requirement-analysis}

Effective prompts are key to getting useful outputs from Git Duo. Here's how to craft prompts for requirement analysis:

### Example Requirement:
```
The application should allow users to filter products by multiple categories simultaneously and sort results by price, popularity, or date added. Filter selections should be maintained when changing sort options.
```

### Effective Prompt Structure:

```
I need to analyze this requirement for testing purposes:
[PASTE REQUIREMENT]

Please:
1. Break down all functional components
2. Identify implicit requirements and assumptions
3. Highlight potential edge cases
4. List possible user scenarios that should be tested
5. Identify integration points with other systems
6. Flag any ambiguous aspects that need clarification
```

### Sample Git Duo Response:

```
## Requirement Analysis

### Functional Components:
- Product filtering by multiple categories simultaneously
- Product sorting by price, popularity, and date added
- Persistence of filter selections during sort changes

### Implicit Requirements:
- UI elements for filter selection (checkboxes, dropdowns, etc.)
- UI elements for sort selection
- Filter and sort operations should perform efficiently
- Results should update dynamically

### Potential Edge Cases:
- No products match the selected filters
- Very large number of filter selections
- Products with identical sort values (e.g., same price)
- Filter by all available categories (equivalent to no filter)

### User Scenarios:
- User selects multiple categories, then changes sort order
- User removes all filter selections
- User rapidly changes filters and sort options
- User applies filters, leaves page, returns (session handling)

### Integration Points:
- Product database/API
- User session management
- Frontend state management

### Ambiguities Requiring Clarification:
- Should filters be AND or OR logic between categories?
- Should sorting preserve previous sorting as a secondary key?
- Are there performance requirements for filter/sort operations?
- How should the system handle invalid filter combinations?
```

## Creating Effective Test Cases with AI {#creating-effective-test-cases-with-ai}

Once requirements are analyzed, Git Duo can help generate comprehensive test cases:

### Test Case Generation Prompt:

```
Based on the requirement analysis, please generate detailed test cases in our standard format:

Test Case ID: [ID]
Test Case Name: [Name]
Objective: [Objective]
Preconditions: [Preconditions]
Test Steps:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...
Expected Results: [Expected Results]
Test Data: [Test Data]
Special Instructions: [Special Instructions]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### Sample Output:

```
Test Case ID: FILTER-SORT-001
Test Case Name: Multiple Category Filter with Sort Change
Objective: Verify that multiple category filter selections are maintained when changing sort options
Preconditions: 
- User is logged in
- Products database has items in multiple categories
- User is on product listing page

Test Steps:
1. Select Category Filter "Electronics"
2. Select additional Category Filter "New Arrivals"
3. Verify products displayed meet both category criteria
4. Change Sort option from default to "Price: Low to High"
5. Verify products remain filtered by both categories
6. Verify products are now sorted by price ascending

Expected Results:
- Products displayed should belong to both "Electronics" AND "New Arrivals" categories
- Product order should change to price ascending
- Filter selections should remain visibly selected in the UI

Test Data:
- User credentials: testuser/password
- Sample products in test database spanning multiple categories

Special Instructions:
- Execute on all supported browsers
- Check mobile responsiveness

Priority: High
```

## Automating Test Cases Using Our Internal Framework {#automating-test-cases}

After creating test cases, Git Duo can help translate them into automation scripts for our internal framework:

### Automation Script Generation Prompt:

```
Please convert this test case into an automation script using our internal framework:

[PASTE TEST CASE]

Our framework uses the following conventions:
- PageObject pattern for UI elements
- TestNG annotations for test structure
- AssertJ for assertions
- Framework-specific classes:
  - TestBase for setup/teardown
  - ProductPage for product listing functionality
  - FilterComponent for handling filters
  - SortComponent for handling sorting
```

### Sample Automation Script:

```java
/**
 * Test case: FILTER-SORT-001
 * Multiple Category Filter with Sort Change
 */
@Test(priority = 1, groups = {"filters", "regression"})
public void testMultipleCategoryFilterWithSortChange() {
    // Login and setup preconditions
    loginPage.loginAsStandardUser("testuser", "password");
    productListingPage.waitForPageToLoad();
    
    // Apply filters
    FilterComponent filters = productListingPage.getFilters();
    filters.selectCategory("Electronics");
    filters.selectCategory("New Arrivals");
    
    // Verify products match both categories
    List<Product> filteredProducts = productListingPage.getDisplayedProducts();
    assertThat(filteredProducts).isNotEmpty();
    assertThat(filteredProducts).allMatch(p -> 
        p.getCategories().contains("Electronics") && 
        p.getCategories().contains("New Arrivals")
    );
    
    // Change sort option
    SortComponent sorter = productListingPage.getSorter();
    sorter.selectSortOption("Price: Low to High");
    productListingPage.waitForProductsToReload();
    
    // Verify filters maintained
    FilterComponent filtersAfterSort = productListingPage.getFilters();
    assertThat(filtersAfterSort.isSelected("Electronics")).isTrue();
    assertThat(filtersAfterSort.isSelected("New Arrivals")).isTrue();
    
    // Verify products still match both categories
    List<Product> productsAfterSort = productListingPage.getDisplayedProducts();
    assertThat(productsAfterSort).isNotEmpty();
    assertThat(productsAfterSort).allMatch(p -> 
        p.getCategories().contains("Electronics") && 
        p.getCategories().contains("New Arrivals")
    );
    
    // Verify sort order
    assertThat(productsAfterSort).isSortedAccordingTo(
        Comparator.comparing(Product::getPrice)
    );
}
```

## Interactive Examples {#interactive-examples}

### Example 1: Ambiguous Requirement Analysis

**Original Requirement:**
```
Users should be able to export reports in different formats.
```

**Interactive Session with Git Duo:**

```
You: Analyze this requirement for testing: "Users should be able to export reports in different formats."

Git Duo: This requirement is quite ambiguous. I need to identify what's missing:

1. Which specific formats are required? (PDF, CSV, Excel, XML, JSON?)
2. Which reports can be exported? (All or specific ones?)
3. Where is the export functionality located in the UI?
4. Are there size limitations for exports?
5. How should the system handle export failures?
6. Are there permissions/roles that affect export capabilities?
7. What metadata should be included in exports?
8. Are there any compliance requirements for exported data?

You: Good points. Let's assume PDF, Excel, and CSV formats for all reports, accessible via an export button on each report page.

Git Duo: Thanks for the clarification. Here's a refined analysis:

[Detailed analysis provided]

Now let me generate initial test cases for this requirement...

[Test cases provided]

You: These look good, but we need to add tests for very large reports that might time out.

Git Duo: Excellent point! Here are additional test cases for performance and error handling scenarios:

[Additional test cases with focus on large reports and timeout handling]
```

### Example 2: Converting Manual Tests to Automation

**Manual Test:**
```
Test: User Registration
1. Navigate to registration page
2. Enter valid information in all fields
3. Click Submit
4. Verify confirmation email is sent
5. Click confirmation link in email
6. Verify user can now log in
```

**Interactive Session with Git Duo:**

```
You: Help me convert this manual test to an automated test using our framework.

Git Duo: I'll help you automate this test. What testing framework and libraries are you using?

You: We use Selenium WebDriver with TestNG and have PageObjects for Registration and Login pages.

Git Duo: Perfect. Here's the automated script:
